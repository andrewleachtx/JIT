# J.I.T. Just In Time

## About
In a day and age where we have to wake up daily to face the gaunlet before us, we have much that is out of our control. Wet socks from rain, a shirt drenched in sweat from the heat, traffic, absurdly long lines for your coffee, buses running off schedule, and too many more. We have a million choices to make in an instant based off of information that we cannot gather, and just like that you can ruin your entire day in that instant.

Too many unknowns, and too much chaos.

The goal of J.I.T. is to take all of the unexpected things that will ruin your day, and _expect them for you._

J.I.T. takes input from a user, such as a wake-up alarm and calendar, and will pull a mass of data accessible online about your location, the weather, traffic, etc... and after that point. J.I.T. will give you all of the information you need to decide.
